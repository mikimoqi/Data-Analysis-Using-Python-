## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our interest is to assess what kind of posts are on Twitter with hashtags of Coronavirus or have descriptions about Coronavirus. Ever since the outbreak of Coronavirus, many people have encountered different impacts among their lives, and some/few people might have expressed their concerns or thoughts through twitter. So our job is to find out what are the common challenges that people have posted during the coronavirus period, for example, speaking from my perspective is: the shortage of food during the pandemic or lack of exercise due to the closure of gyms etc. Some other people might have faced unemployment. We want to analyze what are some of the most common used words/sentences among all twitter posts related to coronavirus? Similarly, which locations have the highest amount of twitter post within a given period or up to date. There are many inspirations and questions to assess from this data set and it is certainly possible to make an user dashboard. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset has 6 columns and more than 5000 rows of tuples. We are intested in analyzing the following variables: Location of the twitter posted at, Tweeted at which date, The original Tweet description, The label of the tweet done by sentiment analysis. We are going to perform analysis on common description such most commonly used words/sentences, and locations with highest of tweets. The data is accumulated from march 3rd, 2020 to April 14th, 2020. The locations the twitter post are determined by their province & country.  The dataset is retrieved from Kaggle.com where the author performed Text Classification on the data and the tweets are pulled from Twitter with manual tagging done on them. The names and usernames are given codes to avoid any privacy concerns which fills up the remaining two columns that I have not explained.
